I've been thinking again about the response to George Floyd's death, and to me the whole 'Defund the Police' movement feels like a sort of revenge fantasy. The narrative was of bad, racist police having too much power and not enough oversight, killing black people with impunity. The Black Lives Matter movement was re-energised, with perhaps a much larger part of the general community engaging positively as a result of witnessing the horrible crime and the callous nature of it. The feeling that 'something should be done' was spreading not only in the US, but around the world. 

I think at that point, really a lot of previously unengaged people were totally on board with some sort of police reform, to fix what anyone with a bit of reading could see was an obvious issue with US policing. And that feeling of fixing a problem was the key to the engagement. People who weren't black, perhaps didn't have much interaction with police, even police officers themselves were feeling empathy for the man killed, a sense of injustice, and an urge to do something. Protests were staged, some peaceful, some not, the media was blowing up, politicians were politicking. But the sense of _outrage_ was just too much. 

The people who had been on the wrong end of police bad behaviour were joined in their anger by well-meaning supporters who absorbed not only the sense of injustice, but the sense of outrage, and the desire for payback. 'Defund the Police' became _the_ slogan of Black Lives Matter supporters on the streets and on social media, and it wasn't just a fix for a problem, it was a visceral lashing out at the whole class of Law Enforcement. 

The idea was almost a victim of itself. Various different definitions were floating about, but the simplicity of the slogan and the tide of emotion that it rode on and reinforced was a perfect meme. Just realistic enough as a concept, it could take hold in the conciousness of people who weren't interested in direct violence or hatred per se, but could still feel the pull of emotion that fuels revenge. It was extreme _political_ violence, rage-filled _abstract_ war. Perfect for young people with a vague need for rebellion against the visible representatives of authority, a good fit for 'woke' liberals who wanted to support BLM against a readily identified enemy, and of course for black people for whom the idea of police violence was not just an abstract concept, revenge was naturally tempting. 

Except it's a totally unrealistic and counter-productive idea, objectively bad in almost every way. The idea of professional, government-run police keeping the peace and enforcing the law in civil society is central to contemporary life in developed countries. You can no more defund the police that you can throw out the government, discard the courts. Anarchy is not a real solution to anything in a real society. 

And it's almost proof that Defund the Police is a bad idea, that the more reasonable the explanation of what should be done to fix the problem, the less it actually involved defunding the police. Some of the ideas put forward as replacements for police were actually pretty interesting. Sending out mental health professionals to engage mentally ill people as first responders is not a bad idea at all, at least worth trying. Except that police would still have to be present in practice, if only as a close-by, out-of-sight backup, because things can always go wrong! So you wouldn't actually be defunding anything. 

The most practical solutions are actually pretty obvious: more and better training; more pay to entice better candidates; closer oversight on selection for recruitment; independent and unbiased investigators of police misbehaviour; removing some of the protections preventing good oversight; better psychological and social support for officers with problems; increased focus on so-called 'community policing' instead of military-style 'operations'. All of these things that could self-evidently improve policing require _more_ funding, not defunding! 

If only the the slogan had been 'Reform the Police', but maybe it's not emotionally engaging enough for the level of outrage that was felt. There's not much revenge in reform, but plenty of practicality.
