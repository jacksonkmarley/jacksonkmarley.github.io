The trend is clear now and Joe Biden will be the 46th President of the United States of America (assuming he makes it to inauguration). The best (not-too-unlikely) outcome from here on is that Biden pulls the Democratic party towards the middle, throws the Republican Senate a few bones, and everyone tries to get through the million other problems facing the country. The difficult but valuable thing that Biden could also do would be to resist the urge to eject all traces of Trump.

Given the (deserved) dislike many now have for Donald Trump, it would be a shame if the iconoclastic changes that he made, or at least advocated, for the better were discarded. It's an unfortunate tendency, not just in politics but in life in general, for people to treat all the ideas of 'bad' people as if the _ideas_ were also automatically bad. Starting a statement with, "Hitler was evil, but he was right about...", would be a great way to get immediate resistance to an idea, no matter how benign. 

Pulling out of the TPP, getting control of illegal immigration, calling out China for bad behaviour, 'draining the swamp', pulling out of endless overseas wars etc. are all actually pretty good general ideas, whether they were implemented or not, and allowing for bad fine-print details. Throwing them all away for being tainted with the Trump touch would be a shame.
