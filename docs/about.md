These blog posts are not a series of newspaper articles. They are not scientific papers, or works of art, or rigid moral or intellectual positions. They are just a collection of my thoughts about the state of the world and how we (regular people with no special knowledge or power) interpret it and search for meaning and understanding. 

I am not trying to provide all of the answers to life's issues, I'm more looking to pose questions and explore my own responses and takes on things I'm exposed to, in the media and among my interests in life. If something I write seems wrong to you, react! Call me out (politely)! Comment and present your opinion (with reasons)! If I think you made a good point I will change my mind! Maybe we'll both learn something, and get others thinking as well. That would be cool.
