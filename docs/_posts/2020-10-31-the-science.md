One of the interesting features of the covid pandemic has been the exposure of large numbers of the general public to information usually of interest only to scientists of a specific field. In that sense climate change provided a bit of a precursor, since media coverage often included terms like 'scientific consensus', which people are now somewhat accustomed to. The idea that there is useful information in scientific publications, potentially available to anyone with an internet connection, is one that has opened new opportunities to those wanting to engage in understanding the current situation. It has also as a result provided a way of pushing back against some of the information and advice broadcast from 'official' sources.

There are positives and negatives to this shift, and I would consider a public more willing to do an internet search for relevant scientific papers that bear on the issue of the day a definite plus. More engagement, critical analysis, just thinking about issues should lead to a more informed electorate and better democratic outcomes (I would hope). 

The pitfalls of mainstream use of asking "what does the science say?" are also becoming apparent. They seem to revolve mainly around how to interpret things like, for example, seeing a scientist or medical doctor on TV explaining something, vs seeing a graph in a media article or on twitter, vs someone on twitter interpreting previous examples for followers, vs looking up some scientific source to see for yourself. It can be a confusing thing if the data is complex, and/or different people have already interpreted it in different ways. 

Those exposed directly to scientific publications (or people citing them), for the first time seem to be falling into the trap of thinking that a specific paper is an authoritative source of scientific knowledge. The realities of how science works in practice might come as a bit of a shock if you think that. 

Let's consider the factors bearing on scientific papers relevant to the covid pandemic. Firstly, they are going to be a mix of medical and epidemiological science, if I can separate the two (not an expert, anyway it shouldn't affect this point). So we are in a field that is dealing with human patient studies, a very complex area at least to me and presumably to most of the population. The differences between correlational and causal relationships alone are a huge source of potential interpreting error, and non-experts are going to have trouble differentiation between the relative strengths of human studies using different methods. 

Secondly, non-scientists are probably not generally aware of the peer-review process of scientific publication. It seems common for them to expect a paper that has been published to be the last word. It's now officially 'science', and as such proof. In reality, any individual paper is in itself a data point supporting or contradicting or refining a given idea, that may be apparently refuted or supported in turn. 

Which brings us to the pace of scientific understanding. It's not usually that fast. Great leaps are usually made from the shoulders of giants, and many papers over periods of years or decades advance accepted knowledge as experiments are repeated, refined, challenged etc. Expecting a stable scientific outcome from a couple of months of rushed work on a new topic is pretty ambitious, even allowing for the resources available. 

The upshot is that it's a tricky business pointing to 'the science' and saying it supports or rejects a certain policy decision. To say nothing of the reality of policy having to take account of more than just, in this case, medical science. Economics, mass psychology, foreign policy, defence, you name it, a global pandemic affects it. So the next time someone talks about "listening to the science", keep in mind that's not the argument ender it appears to be.
