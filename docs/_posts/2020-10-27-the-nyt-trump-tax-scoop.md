There was something weird about the way the world's media jumped on the [NYT article][nyt-trump-taxes-main] about Donald Trump's taxes, and there was something that is totally normal about that article that I don't like.

Firstly I have to admit to being impressed with the piece in a number of ways. It was certainly news, and important news at that, that there were a number of irregularities in the income tax submissions of the sitting President of the United States of America. With an impending election, in a febrile and polarised atmosphere, the NYT dropped a huge investigative reporting coup on the world's media. And they swallowed it whole. It was a well researched, painstakingly described, and meticulously edited propaganda production.

Let me take a step back here and provide some personal opinion context. I am not a US citizen. I won't be voting in the 2020 election, and my interest is only the interest of a person who lives here on Earth, where the most powerful man in the world as of October 2020 is an ex-reality TV show host, and an undeniably polarising figure. His election seems almost inevitable in hindsight. The people who felt left-behind in the US, as they did with Brexit in the UK, sent a clear "up yours" to the political elite in 2016. And the result was a president who seemed to find the idea of being presidential an irrelevance.

The statements he makes do not seem to have much basis in reality, but are more like a stream of conciousness, produced by an apparently wholly narcissistic personality. The policies are a grab-bag of good, bad, and outrageous, sometimes a mix of all three. But I think the main problem for me is that it's like he is taking Western political customs, and throwing away centuries of hard won refinements and improvements. Nepotism, blackmail, corruption, personal aggrandisement carried out on a world scale; Trump is acting like an absolute monarch reigning in centuries past. 

So enter the New York Times. I don't think it's any great revelation to say that it has felt the technological changes of the past decades and rolled with the punches. It has adapted, and for better or worse is not, editorially, the newspaper of record any longer. What does that mean exactly? It may well be that the concept is outdated. Newspapers aren't really paper any more, and news is not just facts to be reported: in the social media based, partisan, polarised, identicised, modern, news-media business world, it doesn't pay to be neutral.

And that's not a new idea. I think it's pretty well accepted by left and right that the _other_ side's media is hopelessly biased. People who don't have a side can just come right out and say it's hard to get honest reporting from _anywhere_.

But now we come to the specific issue of the Trump tax story, which is that everyone read what the NYT writers wanted them to read. People on the left read "Trump is a tax cheat! Trump pays no taxes!" People on the right read "NYT tries to do a hit job on Trump by claiming he pays no taxes! Trump was just obeying the laws of Biden's political class!" People the world over read the headlines, tweets, summaries, maybe a few even read the whole article. Media organisations everywhere reproduced the main point from the original: "He had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years..." Many mentioned the $750 payment as a particular slap in the face. 

So why is this partisan hackery and not what I consider real reporting? Because to me, real reporting is about providing information so that people can understand the world. Any honest report should ask the obvious question: if he paid no income taxes in 10 of 15 years, what did he pay in the other years? Well, it turns out that is a complicated question, that the NYT article addressed in a lot of detail. They wrote about the large income boost from Trump's Apprentice TV show, then about the huge write-off allowed by the Government based on previous year losses etc. But they left out one important point, that a close reading of the numbers suggests implicitly. Ignored by most media and certainly by the army of "Trump pays less tax than me!" tweets was the point made in another, apparently much less read NYT piece, that after all of the usual tax manipulations of the rich, Trump averaged annual income tax payments of over a million dollars. 

Leave aside the large issue of the state of tax law in most western democracies. It was perfectly legal and typical for Trump to carry over losses from one year to offset gains from another year. It is obvious that he would pay less tax some years and more others. If you are telling the honest truth, do you leave out an average of a million dollars a year? Does the implication that Trump pays no tax seem reasonable in that context? For those of you that read the first NYT article, can you honestly say that you are not surprised that he paid an average of over a million dollars per year income tax in the period in question? 

Respect to the media organisations that published that fact, which didn't fit the convenient narrative. Maybe you are reading this and thinking "So what? He's still a crook, and there was plenty of other bad stuff in that article. And also..." Sure, but this is about honest reporting. If such a clear manipulation is standard for the once news-source-of-record, what can we expect elsewhere? The answer is more of the same, of course. The New York Times still has enough integrity to publish the facts, but also enough editorial skill to manipulate them to tell a larger lie. 

How can we incentivise honest reporting going forward? Current trends are heading the other direction, with subscriptions seemingly relying on more and more playing to the audience favourites. Some part of the solution seems to be hitting interested truth-seekers up for direct payments, rather than the previous model of spreading the costs indirectly through ad-revenues etc. But there seem to be less truth-seekers than ideological validation-seekers these days, so the market may be making the truth more expensive.

There is also the possibility that continually searching for neutral reporting is a lost cause, and the market or other forces are just too great. In that case, if you want the truth it may be time you learnt some new skills in active analysing and decoding of unreliable sources. Reading between the lines may become the only source that can really be trusted.
